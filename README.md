This code represents an Android application implementing a simple Whack-A-Mole game with One Direction-themed moles. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

### MainActivity.java

**MainActivity.java** serves as the entry point of the application:
- **Button**: A button to start the game (`startGameButton`).
- **onCreate()**: Sets the layout for the main activity and defines a click listener for the button to start the game.
- **callSecondActivity(View view)**: Launches the `Game` activity when the button is clicked.

### Game.java

**Game.java** contains the main game logic:
- **UI Components**: Various `ImageView` components represent holes and moles, a `TextView` for the timer, and a `ConstraintLayout` to manage the layout.
- **Game Variables**: Static variables for score, timer (`AtomicInteger si`), animation, and a `TimerTask` to manage game events.
- **Animations**: A `ScaleAnimation` for mole hit effect.

**onCreate()**:
- Sets up the layout (`R.layout.activity_game`).
- Initializes `ImageView` components for holes and moles and sets moles' visibility to invisible initially.
- Adds click listeners to the moles. When a mole is clicked:
  - The image changes to show a hit.
  - A scale animation is applied.
  - The mole is hidden after a delay.
  - The score is incremented and `addImageView()` is called if the score is a multiple of 5.
  - The `micVal` is incremented, representing some internal game logic.
  
**TimerTask**:
- Manages the game loop, updating every second.
- Calls `addMethod()` to decrement the timer.
- Calls `checkMole()` to manage mole visibility based on the timer.
- Randomly shows a mole using `animationImageAppear()`.
- Ends the game if the timer reaches zero, showing a "game over" toast and calling `endGame()`.

**addMethod(int k)**:
- Decrements the timer and updates the timer `TextView`.

**endGame()**:
- Hides any visible moles.
- Displays the final score in a new `TextView` centered on the screen.

**addImageView(float val)**:
- Adds a new `ImageView` representing a microphone to the layout when the score is a multiple of 5.
- Manages the layout of the score indicators.

**animationImageAppear(int randVal)**:
- Randomly shows a mole and applies a scale animation.

**checkMole(int siVal)**:
- Hides moles if they have been visible for more than 3 seconds.

**BackgroundSound**:
- Plays background music in a loop using `MediaPlayer`.

### Summary

The application consists of two main activities: `MainActivity` to start the game and `Game` for the actual game logic. The game involves hitting moles that randomly appear, incrementing the score, and displaying animations. The timer counts down, and the game ends when the timer reaches zero, displaying the final score. Background music is played throughout the game.
